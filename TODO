Menu for adding things: machines, stockpile, worker
Stocastic variation in timing
Implement held jobs for man_machine etc.
Walls and pathfinding for workers
Set up room two of factory: pulling lengths, 2x cutting stations, 1x point grinding station
Limit jobs workers can do.
Factory input and output nodes.
BUG: item not being put in existing stockpile location
BUG: stockpile graphic doesn't wrap
If can't replenish, find another job to do (put the job back on the queue)
Do ... something when fulfill input can't be done. Maybe just go idle
Hover on worker to cancel current order (put back to queue)

Replenishment:
Don't want stockpiles to flood the queue with replenishment orders.
Replenishment jobs should only be taken off the queue if the can be fulfilled.
Otherwise they should be skipped.
But this makes it not a fifo queue, which is annoying.
Back to separate queue for replenishment orders which is not a fifo queue.
