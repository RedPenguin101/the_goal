Job / implementation for moving inventory from one stockpile to another
REPLENISH ORDER
A stockpile has a 'replenishment threshold' for any material that is needed.
If the inventory in that stockpile falls below that threshold, a replenishment job is created
The replenishment job causes a worker to find the required material in another stockpile and move it to the target stockpile.

If workers pick up a job but can't complete it, they should idle.
