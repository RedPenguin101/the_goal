Stocastic variation in timing

Implement held jobs for man_machine etc.

Walls and pathfinding for workers

Set up room two of factory: pulling lengths, 2x cutting stations, 1x
point grinding station

Limit jobs workers can do.

Factory input and output nodes.

BUG: stockpile graphic doesn't wrap

Do ... something when fulfill input can't be done. Maybe just go idle

Hover on worker to cancel current order (put back to queue)

REFACTOR: change job queue just to be a normal array like replenishment

REFACTOR: fix inconsistencies in things that take pointers and things that take ids

Improve stockpile puts:
- wrap stockpile graphics on exceed x
- block puts when stockpile is full
- limit size of piles, and overspill to additional piles

Attach stockpile to machine

Add machine through menu

Hire worker through menu

Don't allow stockpiles / machines to be placed over top of eachother.

Draw boxes around stockpiles in black to differentiate
